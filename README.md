# React.js and Node.js Overview

## What is React.js?

React.js is a popular JavaScript library (not exactly a framework) for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications.  
Developed by Facebook, it helps developers build interactive UIs using components.  
React efficiently updates and renders just the right components when your data changes.

## How does React.js work?

- React uses a **component-based architecture**: the UI is divided into small, reusable components.
- It utilizes a **virtual DOM** (Document Object Model). When something changes, React updates only the necessary parts of the real DOM, making updates fast and efficient.

## Node.js Installation Process

Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript outside of the browser, often used to set up the development environment for React applications.

### Installation Steps:

1. Go to the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the prompts.
4. After installation, verify it by running these commands in your terminal:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```
